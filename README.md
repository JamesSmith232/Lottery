<h1 align="center">Lottery</h1>

## Description
This program simulates a person playing the lottery. Allows the user to purchase either a powerball or megamillions ticket. This program 
uses inheritance to increase the reusability of code from other classes. I will include detailed notes inside each file explaining what 
each part does. 

This program has five different classes: Lottery, LotteryTicket, LotteryGame, Powerball, and Megamillions.
 - **_Lottery:_** this class is the application of the Lottery subclasses. This will create all of the menus, allow the 
user to purchase their lottery tickets, and generate the winning numbers. When a user "purchases" a ticket, this class will 
use the respect subclass and set up the ticket using the rules defined by either powerball or megamillions. Checks to 
see if the users ticket is a winner.
 - **_LotteryTicket:_** this class represents purchasing a lottery ticket. Inside this class, it refrences the current object 
to create a powerball or megamillion ticket. It takes the users picks, sorts them and converts them to string. 
- **_LotteryGame:_** is an abstract superclass for the lottery.
